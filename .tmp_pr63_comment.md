Update: branch reset + migration split

- Action: Reset `unit-zero-sim-integration-1st-phase` to `c4035b1` to keep this PR scoped to Phase 1 mirror tests and reporting (as described in the PR body).
- Preservation: Created `punchswap-v3-migration` containing all subsequent PunchSwap V3 deployment/docs/tooling commits. Nothing lost; separation for clarity.
- Why: Mirror tests (FLOW crash, MOET depeg, rebalance) are independent of PunchSwap V3 deployment. V3 work has separate blockers (raw-tx signing/gateway), so it now tracks in its own branch/PR.

Diff notes:
- PR head latest commit: `c4035b1` → 3 files changed, 1080 insertions (CRITICAL_CORRECTIONS.md, FINAL_HONEST_ASSESSMENT.md, HONEST_REASSESSMENT.md).
- Shortstat between `5a858fb` and current PR head: 39 files changed, 5423 insertions(+), 130 deletions(-).

What the 3 mirror tests cover (current Phase 1):
- FLOW flash crash:
  - Validates liquidation via DEX, health recovery post-liq; PASS.
  - Numeric deltas reported without judgement, per PR’s comparison policy.
- MOET depeg:
  - Applies price drop; confirms HF stays unchanged post-depeg as expected; PASS.
  - Follow-up noted to model a test-only liquidity drain (~50%) to tighten parity.
- Rebalance capacity:
  - Executes 5 swaps to reach 10,000 cumulative; PASS.
  - Stop condition matches sim (“max_safe_single_swap”); delta exists due to simplified swapper/oracle vs sim’s V3 math.

- Current PR branch head: `unit-zero-sim-integration-1st-phase` @ `c4035b1`

Next:
- If this split looks good, I’ll open a dedicated PR from `punchswap-v3-migration` and keep this PR focused on Phase 1 mirror tests and the comparator/reporting flow.
