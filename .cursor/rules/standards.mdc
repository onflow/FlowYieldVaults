- Do not use emojis
- All documentation markdown files (.md) should be placed in the `docs/` folder, not in the repository root
- Keep README.md in the root as the only exception
- When writing tests, set expectations based on the architecture and requirements, NOT to make tests pass. Never reduce expected values to match actual behavior - instead fix the implementation to meet expectations.
- Always run all tests locally before pushing changes to verify they pass
